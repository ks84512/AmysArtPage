      Hi my name is Amy Sahoo and I make art! I grew up in 
      Georgia and used things I enjoy to make my art. 
      Some of my art influences include Tv Shows, Music, 
      Scenery, and other pieces of Art.
      
      This page is for me to show everyone my ideas and how I view some
      of my art.

            I call this piece "Migos".This piece is centered around some of my favorite 
            artists right now. The Migos are actually from Georgia 
            and I painted them on a cooler. I used warm shades to create 
            a sunset theme. Then I painted the three heads. I then added some 
            of their lyrics to the bottom to complete the piece. The medium used
            for this piece was acrylic paint. I later sprayed it over with 
            some gloss spray.

              This piece is known as "Trippy Octopus". It is just a
              painting I made for a friend. I got the idea for it after I saw
              it online and decided I wanted to make my own. I used watercolors
              and sharpie to make this piece. I was hoping to achieve a 
              psychedelic feel through the use of bright colors. This piece was 
              very fun to make because I don't typically use watercolors. This was 
              done on a canvas.

             The name of this art is "Floyd". I don't listen to Pink Floyd but I made this as 
             the top of a cooler for formal. This piece was made with acrylic paint. I tried 
             making it similar to pop art but I wanted a space feel. I used a toothbrush dipped
             in paint to spray white dots all over the background, then I made the iconic Pink Floyd
             cover art behind the singers themselves.

              The name of this piece is "Censored". I made this piece because I was tired of 
              people shaming women's bodies. I decided it would be satirical to censor the face and 
              not the body. This piece was done on canvas and uses a wide selection of colors to create 
              contrast between warm and cool. This was done with acrylic paint as well.

                I call this piece "GA Dawgs". This is probably one of the least favorite pieces I have made.
                The only reason I posted it is because the shading goes from black to red in the background which was
                very hard to do since the black is so pigmented. This was another side of the cooler I made last December. 
                It reminds me of all the good times i've had since being at UGA.

               This art is known as "R&M". I got the idea from a hit Tv show called "Rick and Morty". 
               This was another side of the cooler and I created this with acrylic paint as well. 
               I made the green portal background by mixing different shades of green around. I also made
               sure to use light brush strokes to create a swivel effect. I like this piece a lot because
               the text bubble portrays the characters accurately.
